## 📊 Project Highlights

This project analyzes **2 years of e-commerce transaction data** from a Brazilian marketplace to uncover critical insights about customer behavior and churn patterns. Using **RFM segmentation** and **predictive modeling**, I developed data-driven strategies that could potentially increase revenue by **R$8-12 million annually**.

### 🎯 Key Business Impact

| Metric | Current | Target | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Churn Rate** | 70.7% | 55% | ↓ 15.7pp improvement |
| **Repeat Purchase Rate** | 3.1% | 12% | ↑ 4x improvement |
| **Customer Lifetime Value** | Baseline | +40% | Significant revenue growth |

## 🔍 What Makes This Analysis Unique?

✅ **Real-world dataset**: 99,441 actual transactions from Brazilian e-commerce  
✅ **Actionable insights**: Specific retention strategies with ROI calculations  
✅ **Customer segmentation**: RFM analysis identifying 5 distinct customer groups  
✅ **Predictive modeling**: Machine learning model to identify at-risk customers  
✅ **Business recommendations**: 3-tier strategy (immediate, medium-term, long-term)

## 💡 Key Findings

### The Retention Crisis
- **70.7% churn rate** - Most customers never return after first purchase
- **96.9% are one-time buyers** - Massive untapped retention opportunity
- **Champions spend 3x more** than lost customers (R$401 vs R$139)

### High-Impact Opportunities
- **28,726 "At Risk" customers** identified for immediate re-engagement
- **Potential R$619K+ revenue** from converting just 10% to loyal segment
- **9.5x ROI** projected from targeted re-engagement campaigns

### Customer Segments Discovered
1. 🏆 **Champions** (3,264) - 19.7% churn, R$401 avg spending
2. 💎 **Loyal Customers** (4,500) - 38.4% churn, R$381 avg spending
3. 🎯 **Potential Loyalists** (13,486) - 52.5% churn, R$220 avg spending
4. ⚠️ **At Risk** (28,726) - 72.7% churn, R$166 avg spending
5. ❌ **Lost** (47,882) - 82.4% churn, R$139 avg spending
